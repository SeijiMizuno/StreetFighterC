# Fighting Game - Programming 2 Project

This project was developed for the **Programming 2** course in the **Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science** at UFPR.

## Objective

The main goal of this project was to develop a fighting game inspired by **Street Fighter 2**, using **C**. It was proposed as a practical application of event-driven programming concepts.

## Tools and Libraries

The graphical interface for the game was built using the **Allegro5** library.

## How to Run the Game

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Make sure the **Allegro5** library is installed.
2. Open a terminal.
3. Navigate to the gameâ€™s directory (`/sym22-T3T4`).
4. Run the following command:

```bash
make
